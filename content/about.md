# About Me

Hi all, I'm Jonathan! 

I'm currently studying game development at CSU Chico with the dreams of eventually creating my own games independently. 

I'm an enthusiast in many things tech related, including programming, digital arts, graphic design, video games, computer hardware, and microcontrollers! 

I like creating my own things from scratch. The idea that "I can make this" with as minimal of a set of tools as possible and as much control as I want just fascinates me. I'll often experiment and dabble with technology as it piques my interest. Though, sometimes I get distracted and start more projects than I finish. However, the satisfying feeling of a new project coming together into a working prototype or even a finished tool just brings me back to these hobbies!
