For this blog, we were tasked with finding two sources to provide a brief summary of, and cite using APA format. As I am part of a group project that wants to experiment with Virtual Reality, I looked for certain articles relevant to that particular field.

Yamashita, Y. (2025, April 8). *“けもみみ”を触られる感覚を人間は得られるか？　慶大と東大がVRで検証　バーチャルナイフで切る実験も [Can humans get the feeling of being touched by \"Kemonimi\"?　Keidai and the University of Tokyo verified in VR, and the experiment of cutting with a virtual knife] (English translation via Firefox Translation)*. ITmedia NEWS. https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2504/08/news062.html

This article shares the findings from a study conducted by the University of Japan. The study investigates whether people can adopt and feel ownership to new body parts (particularly cat ears) when in a virtual environment. They used a special device to provides tactile feedback based on what an avatar in virtual reality would have felt when being pet. Participants have demonstrated that the tactility does lead some to feel like they owned their avatar's cat ears. Also some showed emotional responses when presented with a threat of the virtual ears being cut by a virtual knife.

This could lead to inspirations on how we can create a product to immerse consumers with tactile feedback cooresponding to virtual elements.

Heaney, D. (2025, July 28). *Meta & Stanford's thin holographic display brings "VR glasses" closer to reality*. UploadVR. https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-stanford-synthetic-aperture-waveguide-holography-vr-glasses-research/

This article describes a breakthrough in a brand new display technology being developed by Meta and Stanford. Ordinary VR headsets often uses screens with a fixed focal point. However, human eyes were not designed to see objects at distances with a fixed focal point, which can lead some to feel eye soreness and stress after VR sessions. This new display technology allows visuals be seen at varying focal points, allowing our eyes to naturally focus to objects in the distance.
