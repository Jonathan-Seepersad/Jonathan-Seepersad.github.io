# Static Bog



Static Bog is a 3D platforming game created in Unity by me and two other teammates. We wanted to make our mechanic centered around using guns in order to propel the player similar to what gamers often refer to as the ["Rocket Jump"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_jumping).

I played the role of the lead programmer as I created much of the behavior for the player's movement, the recoil for the rocket jump ability, Behavior of environment objects such as collectables, moving platforms, respawn points, end the end goal.

I also am the one behind much of it's stylized look, using flat shading and gradient colors to give it that classic retro look (to an extent at least). While it wasn't exactly my role, I also remoddeled the assets and applied textured color to them to keep our material and texture count low. I used a special technique where each object shares one single material and texture that is only 64x64 pixels (can find out about that technique [here](/blog/cagd370/eportfolio-post-4/)).

Using Unity's HTML5 target, we were able to create exports that can be played in the browser without having to install any new piece of software! You can check out our final results [here](/blog/CAGD370/StaticBogFinalPrototype/).
